Alg Trainer is a website that makes it easy to memorize Rubik's Cube algorithms. 

In July 2017, I used this trainer to memorize full ZBLL (493 algorithms) in only 58 days, a feat which I describe in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TEtHB5eoZw). 

## Features

- [Giiker Smart Rubik's Cube support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PWErrApqWQ)
- Supports PLL, OLL, F2L, COLL, WV, ZBLL, 2GLL, ZZLL, ZBLS, CLS, TTLL, CMLL, TOLS, CLL, CPEOLL, OLLCP, and much, much more. 
- Train algsets by their subsets - for example, you can train the T, U, L, Pi, H, S and AS subsets of ZBLL separately.
- Features a timer for timing your algorithms.
- Real scrambles - scrambles are not just the reverse of the algorithm. It won't be possible to guess the algorithm just by looking at the scramble!
- Pressing spacebar shows you the algorithm you should use. No more searching for algs in pdf documents!
- Virtual cube. Learning algs with a virtual cube saves a ton of time because you don't need to scramble your cube. I used this when I was learning full ZBLL.
- Customizable controls: The default keyboard controls for turning the virtual cube are based on a ergonomic layout designed by Ryan Heise. However it is possible to customize the controls to whatever you want! 
- User defined algset - Have a list of algs you want to train? No problem, just paste them into the "User defined algset" box.
